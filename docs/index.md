`pySWATPlus` is an open-source Python package that provides a programmatic interface to the [SWAT+](https://swat.tamu.edu/software/plus/) model, allowing users to run simulations and conduct custom experiments.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Run `SWAT+` simulations by modifying model parameters through the  `calibration.cal` file..
- Evaluate model performance against observed data using widely recognized statistical indicators.
- Perform sensitivity analysis on model parameters using the [`SALib`](https://github.com/SALib/SALib) Python package.
- Calibrate model parameters through multi-objective optimization and evolutionary algorithms using the [`pymoo`](https://github.com/anyoptimization/pymoo) Python package. 
- Execute sensitivity analysis and model calibration through high-level interfaces with built-in parallel computation support.
- Analyze outputs from model simulations, sensitivity analyses, and calibrations.
